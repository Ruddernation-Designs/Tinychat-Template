# Currently working on the version for this so check up on it in a few days maybe, Just be patient please.


# Tinychat-API
This version of the Tinychat API is for a website running PHP without the need for WordPress, Just upload and go.

If you require the WordPress version then for the latest up to date version use the WordPress directory <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tc-room-spy/" target="_blank" title="Tinychat API - WordPress">Tinychat API</a>.

For the versions that I update first then you can use the version on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Ruddernation-Designs/Tinychat-API-WordPress" target="_blank" title="Tinychat API - GitHub">Tinychat API</a>.
